Steps to configure kit and run the program:

1. Download the .asm files from here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qdckG4TJEpyqrWJtO0gNKLQKyPpix_Gq
2. Copy them to the directory esa-xt85 in your local machine.
3. Use command "c16 -h 1.hex -l 1.lst 1.asm" and "c16 -h 2.hex -l 2.lst 2.asm" in command prompt
4. Switch no. 4 should be turned to serial mode.
5. Download the hex file into the kit using xt85.exe, one at a time.
6. Switch no. 4 should be turned back to initial position.
7. Connect the Stepper Motor circuit to J1 port.
8. Connect the ADC to port J2
9. Connect the Function generator to ADC.

Steps to run program 1:

1. Select a waveform with maximum amplitude less than or equal to 3.5V.
2. Press "Go" and enter "9000" via keyboard, then press "Exec".
3. The speed of rotation of shaft (rpm)n is directly proportional to input analog voltage given. 
4. The corresponding digital equivalent of input is displayed on the data field of kit.

Steps to run program 2:

1. Select a dc voltage of 0V and align the dial correctly.
2. Select a constant voltage waveform (square wave with very low frequency) with voltage between 0-3.1V.
3. Press "Go" and enter "9000" via keyboard, then press "Exec".
4. The pointer rotates by an angle proportional to the input voltage.
5. You may change input voltage, then press "Go" to see changes in pointer angle.
6. Input voltage greater than 3.1V will cause rotation of more than 360 degrees.
